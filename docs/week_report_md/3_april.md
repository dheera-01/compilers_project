# Weekly Report - 3 April 23

## @chirag-25
Yet to add.

## Dheeraj Yadav(@dheera-01)
Implemented static type checking in separate file. Also wrote some basic pytest cases for different cases.

## Rahul Rai(@RahulRai02)
Debugged code for iteration over lists

The majority of the time spent on this task was devoted to debugging the code for iterating over the lists. The original implementation was causing unexpected errors when iterating over lists, but after careful inspection, the issue was identified and resolved. This commit on branch "Issue_37" includes the corrected code for iterating over lists.

The testcase is currently written in program.txt

## @Sandeep-Desai
The following work done this week:

Previously, the function could have only one return statement, solved that issue and now we can write multiple return statements in a function.
Implemented parser for function declaration and function call.
Previously, the if return statement is some other constructs such as if, while, for, etc. then the return statement was not working. Solved that issue by raising return value as exception and catching it in the main function.
Wrote some test cases for the above mentioned issues.
Now the following example works:
Simple Hello world print function;
Functions to add two numbers and return the sum
Function with if and else statements
Function with while loop
Factorial function implemented using recursion
The following work is planned for next week:

Solve some issues related some complex recursive functions such as fibonacci series.
Current implementation of function may have some unknown scoping related issues which needed to be addressed.

## Sankskriti Sarkar(@Sanskriti-56)
Reviewed code for unary boolifying operator and fixed errors in it.

Completed function feature of the language. 
Wrote parser for functions and solved some errors related to the same. 
Previously there was an issue with the return statement, which was fixed. 
Now functions can have multiple return statements. 
Also, recursive functions are done. Tested for cases like Fibonacci, factorial, and odd-even.

## Sankskriti Sarkar(@Sanskriti-56)
I am working on implementing bytecode generation for arithmetic operations, the logic of the code is corect however due to some reason, the code is going to case BUG whenever it is run,I suspect that the reason behind this is incorrect integration of parser with bytecode generator.

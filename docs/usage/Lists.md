# Lists

Lists can be declared in the way we declared lists in python language. The syntax is in the form of `[]` brackets. The list can be declared in a similar way as we declare a variable. So basically, we are assigning a identifier to a list when `assign` is called.

### Syntax

 #### Example 1:-
```python
# INPUT
assign arr = [1, 2, 3, 11, 18];
print(arr);
```
```python
# OUTPUT
[1, 2, 3, 11, 18]
```
#### Example 2:-
```python
# INPUT
assign arr = ["Hi", 2, "hello", 11, 18];
print(arr);
```
```python
# OUTPUT
["Hi", 2, "hello", 11, 18]
```
#### Example 3:-
Here we have made the list declaration in such a way that it can be reassigned as well. Example is shown below:-

```python
# INPUT
assign arr = [1, 3, 5, 11, 29];
print(arr);

arr = [2, 4, 6, 12, 30];
print(arr);
```

```python
# OUTPUT
[1, 3, 5, 11, 29]
[2, 4, 6, 12, 30]
```

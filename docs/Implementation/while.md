# While Loops

While loops consists of two components, first is condition and second is the body. While condtions evaluates to true we execute the body. 
Body is a block of code that is executed repeatedly until the condition evaluates to false. After completion while loop returns ```None```. 

To implement the repeatative nature of while loop we used inbuilt python while loop. First we tried it using recursion but when tested this implementation against infinite loop, the maximum recursion depth of python exceeded.

We can see exact implementation of while loop by looking at the code below.

```python



```

Whenever we enter a while loop we create a new scope. Once evalaution of while loop is done we destroy this scope. 

## Example

```python
```
